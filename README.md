# Fine Grained Optimization of Deep Neural Networks

In this repo, PyTorch and Tensorflow code of the algorithms proposed in the following work will be provided:

Mete Ozay, Fine-grained Optimization of Deep Neural Networks, abs/1905.09054, 2019.

Note: Organizing and cleaning code may take some time due to my current crazy workload. 

If you are very excited about the beautiful theory and algorithms, you are interested in implementing the algorithms and you are in hurry, then please feel free to contact me [mailto](meteozay@gmail.com) to discuss the details. I am more than happy to help you.
